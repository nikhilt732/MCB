# website
a website using html and css

JUST CLONE THE FILE ON THE DESKTOP AND OPEN YOUR BROWSER AND TYPE file:///C:/Users/MUJ/Desktop/website/index.html#fff
TO RUN THE CODE.
I HAVE USED THE LOGO AND CONTENT FROM  'MY COLLEGE BUDDY'.

if you want to add a slideshow copy the html code in index.html
and use css to change style as per your need.

thank you and you can ask your doubts .
